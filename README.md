# 🌡️ Temperature Data Client and Server in Python

Welcome to the Temperature Data Client and Server repository, where we provide temperature data between 20 and 30 degrees Celsius. This repository includes the following:

- `client.py`: Python script for the client.
- `server.py`: Python script for the server.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/GabrielPavanati/TCP-Server.git

2. Navigate to the `source` directory:
   
   ```shell
   cd TCP-Server/source

3. Run the server:

   ```shell
   python server.py

The server will now be listening for incoming client connections.

4. In a separate terminal, run the client:

   ```shell
   python client.py

The client will capture temperature data from the server and save it.
